Issues arising while programming the parser:

1. Note that <measure> elements can be empty (i.e. <measure/>), but only when
   inside <global> elements. (Maybe make that clearer in the spec.)
2. We need a Regex for "metrical location"
   See https://w3c.github.io/mnx/specification/common/#measure-location
3. §6.8.1 says
   "All directions within a directions parent element must be given an explicit
   measure location by supplying a location attribute. The default measure
   location is zero."
   Can the location attribute in a <directions><directions> be omitted or not?
4. §6.4.1 id attribute is missing for note
5. §6.6.2 should say that "tied" has Liaison Attributes (i.e. a "target" attribute)
6. §6.6.2 location is a "measure location" but can also have the values "incoming"
   and "outgoing". I'm assuming that the latter are forms of "measure location",
   and should be added to its definition...
7. §6.7.2 should provide a formal (blue) definition of "slur".
8. §6.3.3 "beamed" elements have an optional "id" attribute (missing in the blue
   definition)
9. §4.10 I assume that the Note Value string can have an arbitrary number of
   'd's corresponding to the number of dots. That could be made more explicit.
   Actually, we really need a Regex expression that formally defines NoteValue's
   content, complemented perhaps by something like the existing informal description
