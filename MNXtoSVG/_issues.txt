Issues arising while programming the parser:

1. Note that <measure> elements can be empty (i.e. <measure/>), but only when inside <global> elements. (Maybe make that clearer in the spec.)
2. Need a Regex for "metrical location" -- see https://w3c.github.io/mnx/specification/common/#measure-location
3. §6.8.1 says "All directions within a directions parent element must be given an explicit measure location by
   supplying a location attribute. The default measure location is zero."
   Can the location attribute in a <directions><directions> be omitted or not?
4. id attribute is missing for note (in §6.4.1)
5. §6.6.2 target attribute is missing in the definition of "tied"
6. §6.6.2 location is a "measure location" but can also have the values "incoming" and "outgoing".
   Are the latter two "measure location"s? I'm assuming that's the case.
