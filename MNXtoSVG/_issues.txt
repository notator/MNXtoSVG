Issues arising while programming the parser:

1. Note that <measure> elements can be empty (i.e. <measure/>), but only when inside <global> elements. (Maybe make that clearer in the spec.)
2. Need a Regex for "metrical location" -- see https://w3c.github.io/mnx/specification/common/#measure-location
3. §6.8.1 says "All directions within a directions parent element must be given an explicit measure location by
   supplying a location attribute. The default measure location is zero."
   Can the location attribute in a <directions><directions> be omitted or not?
4. §6.4.1 id attribute is missing for note
5. §6.6.2 should say that "tied" has Liaison Attributes (i.e. a "target" attribute)
6. §6.6.2 location is a "measure location" but can also have the values "incoming" and "outgoing".
   I'm assuming that the latter are forms of "measure location", and should be added to its definition...
7. §6.7.2 should provide a formal (blue) definition of "slur"
